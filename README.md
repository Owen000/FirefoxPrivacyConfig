# FirefoxPrivacyConfig

This is a config that I have made that you can set in your profiles folder in the .mozilla directory. 
It is based off of privacytools.io and a few other things.

Thanks to upsidedown from the Arch Linux discord for helping me to convert it to a User.js file.

Recommened extensions:
